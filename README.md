# MyReads Project

This is my submission for the first project in "React" Udacity course. The starter project was forked from 'https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter'. I had ton of fun working on refactoring code into components and adding features. I liked this approach of designing a static template first then refactor it into a functional application. I have tried to follow the best practices as much as I could.

# Test Project

To get started testing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
